# ML2-assignments
Solutions to Advanced Machine Learning Assignments 2018-19 from BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus in C++ with STL
Code for each assignment is within the src folder within the folder for each assignment
## Matrix Class
Include the matrix.h file in the code which needs to make use of matrix operations by
```cpp
#include "matrix.h"
```
This header file is an implementation of a matrix class with a large number of operations needed for these assignments
The class aims to support the kind of matrix operations similar to the ones supported by numpy.
# Assignment 1
Implementation of 3 different linear classification models from chapter 4 of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop
1. Fischer's Linear Discriminant Method
2. Probabilistic Generative Model
3. Logistic Regression

# Assignment 2
Implementation of feedforward neural networks along with backpropagation. Developed in a modular fashion where in the number of layers and number of neurons in each layer can be specified


# Assignment 3
Implementation of 2 models in keras for digit recognition
1. Simple NN Model
2. CNN Model
